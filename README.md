## Google Trends Search Interest for 2025 Color of the Year

![Color Trends Plot]([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/yourrepo/main/color_trends_plot.png](https://github.com/ameyaadesai/Ameyaa-Desai-Personal-Dataset-Project/blob/main/color_trends_plot.png?raw=true
)

This plot compares Google Trends weekly search interest for Butter Yellow and Dill Green—two colors predicted as potential “Color of the Year” candidates for 2025. Butter Yellow shows a strong rise through mid-year with peak interest around weeks 25–30 before gradually declining, whereas Dill Green exhibits more variable and generally lower search volumes. The higher and more sustained interest in Butter Yellow suggests that public attention leaned more heavily toward this color during the year.
