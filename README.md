# Background
Each year, Pinterest releases its [“Pinterest Palette”](https://business.pinterest.com/blog/2025-pinterest-palette-this-years-trending-colors/), a collection of five colors they believe will shape design, fashion, and cultural aesthetics in the coming year. These selections stem from Pinterest’s proprietary trend-spotting methodology, which draws on years of data-driven forecasting through Pinterest Predicts. In this project, I examine how these predicted colors actually play out beyond the Pinterest ecosystem. While Pinterest identifies five potential “colors of the year,” my goal is to determine which color truly resonates most with the broader public. To do this, I take Pinterest’s chosen palette and compare the five colors using Google Trends data, analyzing search interest to identify which color captured the most attention.

# Motivating Question
Can the Pinterest Palette be trusted by businesses hoping to capitalize on emerging aesthetics, and which of its predicted colors ultimately proved most popular over the year?

## Google Trends Search Interest for 2025 Color of the Year

![Color Trends Plot](https://github.com/ameyaadesai/Ameyaa-Desai-Personal-Dataset-Project/blob/main/color_trends_plot.png?raw=true)


This plot compares Google Trends weekly search interest for Butter Yellow and Dill Green—two colors predicted as potential “Color of the Year” candidates for 2025. Butter Yellow shows a strong rise through mid-year with peak interest around weeks 25–30 before gradually declining, whereas Dill Green exhibits more variable and generally lower search volumes. The higher and more sustained interest in Butter Yellow suggests that public attention leaned more heavily toward this color during the year.
